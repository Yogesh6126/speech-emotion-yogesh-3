## 🧠 About
This project analyzes human speech to detect emotions such as **happy, sad, angry, neutral** using a machine-learning model.

- Generates synthetic audio, so you can run it offline in Colab  
- Replace `audio_samples` and `metadata.csv` with real datasets like **RAVDESS** or **CREMA-D**  
- Uses **RandomForestClassifier** for speed and simplicity (you can upgrade to deep learning later)

## 🚀 How to Use

2. In Colab, go to **Runtime → Run all**.  
3. The notebook will generate synthetic speech samples and classify their emotions.
